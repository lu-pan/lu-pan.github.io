**Exploring recent aqueous environments on Mars**

The timing, duration, and physical state of liquid water on Mars are crucial parameters to understand how the planet's climate has evolved. During my Ph.D., I have implemented a data procesing pipeline to analyze hyperspectral images that accentuate the hydrous mineralogy in the CRISM datasets. Using this dataset incombination with topography and high resolution imagery, we could identify and understand in detail what the aqueous environments look like through the hisory of Mars.

**Studying landing sites and support current space explorations**

As a collaborator on the InSight science team working on the geologic background and subsurface structure at the landing site of InSight lander. Based on the identification of Fe/Mg phyllosilicates and layered, yardang-forming materials in the central peaks near the lander, the results suggest the existence of a potential weak layer consist of sediments beneath the lava flows. These analyses serve a guide to interpreting seismic data acquired by the seismometer (SEIS) onboard InSight lander, as well as the geological interpretations for the nature and age of the magnetic field detected by the InSight FluxGate (IFG) magnetometer. To support planetary missions, I also participated in the work to characterize the mineralogy of the selected landing site at Oxia Planum for ExoMars rover mission with European Space Agency (ESA), and I supervised a master student to investigate science targets in landing regions of China's 2020 rover.

**Unraveling early impact records with crater depth statistics**

Early impact bombardment history on the planet Mars has been obscured by the dynamic geological processes, including impact, volcanic, aeolian, and fluvial activities. Based on a spatial correlation between positive gravity anomaly with regions lacking buried impact craters identified in the Chryse Planitia near the dichotomy of Mars, I revisit the origin of Chryse Planitia. Through collaboration with colleagues, I analyze the gravity data and deploy an impact crater statistics model to account for the observed correlation. By tracing the population of impact craters with varying depths, we suggest the Chryse basin is, in fact, a large buried impact basin that has been quickly viscously relaxed. This work shows that there are potentially many large buried basins on Mars with surface expressions erased, and the current impact records of the martian surface are far from complete. The different states of relaxation in these large ancient basins may also help place crucial constraints on the thermal evolution of the planet.

**Understanding mixing in natural rock samples at a microscale**

I'm interested in exploring and improving the methodology of remote sensing for spectroscopy analysis to better quantify mineral abundances. I have recently started to investigate the effect of rock textures on the mixing of different components using hyperspectral imagers at different scales. With measurements using hyperspectral cameras, I will test existing mixing models previously proposed for particulate materials and investigate martian meteorites to gain insights on the compositional trends of the martian mineralogy shown by remote sensing data.
