**Intro:**

Hello world! My name is Lu Pan. I am a planetary geologist interested in the geologic and climatic evolution of planets. I am now affiliated with the University of Copenhagen. Before moving to Copenhagen at beginning of March, I was a Marie Curie postdoc fellow at the University of Lyon. 

My primary interest is to use remote sensing datasets to understand the chemical and physical processes that shape the surfaces of planetary bodies, and the resulting planetary evolution through time. In particular, I aim at combining the mineralogic and morphologic information to improve our view of the interior as well as the surface environments of our red planet -Mars.

In addition, I am also trying to better understand and develop the techniques to document and resolve geological processes using remote sensing, in particular, through spectroscopy. To disentangle how light interacts with solid materials in the solar system and beyond, we may have a better chance to illuminate the paths during the search for habitable environments elsewhere. 

I am recently involved in the Mars [InSight lander](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/insight/) and [Mars Science Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-science-laboratory-curiosity-rover-msl/) missions as an external science collaborator on the mission. I also participated in the landing site selection and characterization of Perserverance rover [Mars 2020](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/) and the Rosalind Franklin rover in the [ExoMars mission](http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/ExoMars). 

When I'm not looking at images of Mars, I enjoy playing volleyball üèê and hiking ‚õ∞. I'm also a big fan of coffee and tropical fruits üççüççüçç.
