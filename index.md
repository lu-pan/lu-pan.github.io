Hello world! Welcome to my page. I am a planetary geologist interested in the geologic and climatic evolution of planets. I am now working (from home) as everyone in the University of Copenhagen. Before moving to Copenhagen at beginning of March, I was a postdoc researcher at the University of Lyon.
