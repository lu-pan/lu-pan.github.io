**Intro:**

Hello world! My name is Lu Pan. I am a planetary geologist interested in the geologic and climatic evolution of planets. I am now working (from home) as everyone else, affiliated with the University of Copenhagen. Before moving to Copenhagen at beginning of March, I was a postdoc researcher at the University of Lyon. 

I am interested in all sorts of surface processes that occur on planetary bodies, including fluvial, aeolian, impact and volcanic processes. I am also trying to better understand and develop the techniques to document and resolve geological processes using remote sensing methods, in particular, spectroscopy.

**News:**
- 2020.3 We celebrated the publication of InSight papers on Nature Geoscience at the team meeting in Nice, France. I have officially moved to Denmark at the beginning of March.
